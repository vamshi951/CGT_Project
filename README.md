## 🧮 Project Title
**Derivation of the Outer-Independent Roman Domination Number for the Lexicographic Product \( P₃ \circ Pₙ \)**

---

## 📖 Abstract
This project derives the **Outer-Independent Roman Domination Number (OIRDN)** for the **Lexicographic Product of Path Graphs** \( P₃ \circ Pₙ \).  
It presents detailed proofs, base cases, and step-by-step derivations for multiple values of *n*, supported by visual graphs and examples for correctness verification.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Lexicographic Product of Graphs  
- Outer-Independent Roman Domination Function  
- Proof by Mathematical Induction  
- Examples for Path Graphs \( P₄, P₅, P₆, P_{10}, P_{15} \)  
- Corona Product of Graphs and its OIRDN Formula

## 🧠 Key Results

### Lexicographic Product:
\[
\gamma_{oiR}(P₃ \circ Pₙ) = \lceil n/3 \rceil + n + 2 \lfloor n/2 \rfloor
\]

### Corona Product:
\[
\gamma_{oiR}(P₃ \circ Pₙ) = 3 \times 2 + 3 \lfloor n/2 \rfloor
\]

Both results were proven using **inductive reasoning** and validated with examples.
